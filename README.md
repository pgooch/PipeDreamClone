# Pipe Dream Clone

_I'll come up with a better name later._

### Using Nodemon for Development

The following command will run nodemon, have it watch the directory for changes, and automatically build on save.

```
nodemon -e lua --exec "pdc ./ ../PipeDreamClone.pdx"
```

Naturally you'll need nodemon installed globally for this to work.

## Preparing Spritesheets
New sprite sheets are not implemetend yet, however the pre-process/js will take the exports contents and automate a bunch of the work. THis still needs to be finished up.

In order to not have Photoshop take ages to export each layer use https://github.com/antipalindrome/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/, already installed where it says to install it.
