# Pipe Dream Clone

_I'll come up with a better name later._

### Using Nodemon for Development
The following command will run nodemon, have it watch the directory for changes, and automatically build on save.
```
nodemon --exec pdc ./ ../Pipe\ Dream\ Clone.pdx *.lua
```
Naturally you'll need nodemon installed globally for this to work.
