# Pipe Dream Clone

_I'll come up with a better name later._

## Runnables
 - `npm run dev` Starts node monitor watching/building the .pdx from src.
 - `npm run buildSprites` Compiles a spritesheet

## Preparing Spritesheets
New sprite sheets are not implemetend yet, however the pre-process/js will take the exports contents and automate a bunch of the work. THis still needs to be finished up.

In order to not have Photoshop take ages to export each layer use https://github.com/antipalindrome/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/, already installed where it says to install it.
